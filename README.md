# Parking-System
- The Parking System we will build will be a simple console-based application that allows users to park their cars, removed their cars and view all parked cars. It presents a menu with four options: park a car, remove a car, view parked cars, and exit the program.

- User needs to provide total number of parking slots and then main menu will be displayed for further operations. In park car method, we will check for availability of slots. If slots are available then user will provide car license number and message will be displayed as “Car parked successfully”. 

- In remove car method, we will check for number of parked cars if it appears as zero then process will not go further. By entering license number of parked car one can simply removed it. Inbuilt functions of Array List ‘add’ and ‘remove’ are used to add cars in array list and remove it from the array list, respectively.

- Along with the process of adding and removing the available slots will get decrement and increment accordingly. For displaying all parked cars we have used for each loop and displaying Array List named as parked cars.

- All these three methods have been called for particular case of switch case.
